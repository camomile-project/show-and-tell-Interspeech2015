  \section{Introduction}
      \subsection{Context}
Introduce the Camomile project in general terms. Then IMHO (Pierrick), owing to the space limitations, and for the sake of clarity, we should better restrict the presentation to one of the use cases - as far as the title goes, I guess we should relate to the active learning use case and the dry run experience. 

Resp : all

 \subsection{Demo Content}
The demo shows the shot annotation interface. As for the document structure, I would go the other way: first talk about the use case, and then about the interactive tools to support it. Else we have to talk about a problem that has not been already introduced.

% Pierrick: from Mateusz' queue find a more illustrative example, i.e. with context annotation outside the current shot

The latter displays the video title, and reveals additional details when activated. 3) The textfield to type the annotation. Multiple annotations are supported, and summarized in a table.}

\end{figure}

% Pierrick: during my trials for the demo video, I found that the annotation list was more annoying than anything else - I has to scroll everytime to do (next), whereas fitting in screen height would make things easier. Also, are multi-annotations to be supported?

An overview of our visual tool is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:frontend}. It heavily uses the display features provided by HTML5 and D3.js \cite{d3js}. The angular.js framework \cite{angularjs} provides an efficient MVC framework to easily coordinate multiple views. The latest version of our tool is available at \cite{urlfrontend}.



Though there are two main use cases, described in Section \ref{sec:shot} and \ref{sec:head}, components are mostly the same for both: the shot or the frame to annotate is displayed in a HTML5 video player and its metadata is shown under the player. The input of a set of annotations is supported by a textfield and a summary table.\\

Both use cases are part of an active learning loop. Each step outputs a selected list of annotations to be performed. Potentially multiple users connect to this list through the frontend, and process annotations in order. They can either validate an annotation of the current shot, or skip it if they feel unsure about it.


% Pierrick: do we talk about both head and shot annotation, or only shot?
\subsubsection{Annotate shot} \label{sec:shot}
In the first use case, a user has to name the speaker in the shot. The player, restricted to the shot, allows to explore it at length.\\
Owing to the iterative nature of the active learning algorithm, the current speaker might have already been annotated elsewhere in the video. Seeking beyond the current shot might reveal such annotations. This obervation led us to propose a \emph{context bar}, which provides the usual features of a seek bar, while revealing annotations performed in previous steps as overlay. A time span can be parametrized around the current shot, highlighted in red (see Figure \ref{fig:frontend}). Hovering over contextual annotations displays a tooltip containing a video thumbnail and the associated annotation.\\

\subsubsection{Annotate head} \label{sec:head}
% Pierrick: did not change anything here for now
The second one corresponds to give the identity of a on screen appearing person. This time, we thought there was no need to scroll through the video, so only the correspong frame is dislayed to the user. As many person can be on screen, we had to help user to figure out which one have to be identified. That's why we add a layer on the frame, on which we drew a red square surronding the head of the right person.\\

      \subsection{Active learning backend}
%(présenter l'approche LIG - retraining and adaptation - et pointer sur le lien github précis - y passer plus de temps 

%Resp : Matheusz
In order to make the annotations provided by the users more informative an active learning system 
was developed. The approach can be described as an unsupervised active learning. In it, no biometric models are trained, but rather a clustering is preformed,
which divides the data in a way that, ideally, each cluster corresponds to an individual person.  In this method a hierarchical clustering algorithm was used 
following the  approach presented in \cite{poignant2012unsupervised}.  The clusters consist of tracks: speech (based on speaker diarization),  face (the result of face tracking) or both in the case of multimodal clusters. In the latter case, the distance between tracks from different modalities is based on the output of the multilayer perceptron \cite{bredin2012fusion}.

At each step of the algorithm, the user is presented with a set of tracks for annotation. Afterwards, the clustering is refined when the new annotations are introduced.
The label given to a particular track is propagated to the whole corresponding cluster. Next, a selection strategy is applied, which either tries to verify the correctness of the existing annotated clusters or label new ones.
A more in-depth description of the method can be found in \cite{budnik2014automatic}.

  \section{Dry run evaluation}
      \subsection{Use case : multimodal speaker annotation}
     
%décrire la tâche et les participants à l'expe

%Resp : Mateusz
The task consists of annotating speakers in a video. The speech tracks were extracted automatically following the approach presented in \cite{barras2006multistage}.
Each participant was presented with a video fragment corresponding to the time frame of a speech track and was asked to give the name of the person who is speaking at the moment.
The user had also  access to the whole video. Due to the nature of the videos (TV news broadcasts), most people were presented either by an overlaid written or a spoken name.
 
      
      \subsection{Quantitative analysis}
 
 In the dry run 9 participants took part. The annotations were done simultaneously and lasted for around 1.5 hours pre user.
In this run only the speaker annotation scenario was tested. The corpus consisted of 62 videos from the REPERE dataset \cite{giraudel2012repere}, which included TV debates, news programs and parliamentary broadcasts among others.  

During the run, a total of 716 speech tracks were annotated. This corresponds to 4875 seconds of speech (around 81 minutes) Additionally, 654 were marked as skipped. This is due to the automatic extraction of tracks where some do not contain speech, but music, external noises, etc. The total time of all the tracks that were seen by the annotators is 8934 seconds (148,9 minutes.)
After removing the outliers (for example: due to people leaving the annotation system for an extended period of time while still logged in) the average annotation time is 20.0s and the median is equal to 10.8s.

Additionally, because of the clustering present in the system, the annotations were propagated to the corresponding clusters. This produced a total number of 3504 labeled tracks (including the 716 annotated manually) with the total time equal to 7.81 hours. Also, the use of the multimodal clusters during the dry run enabled to get face annotation (1973 head annotation and 5.47 hours total time)
without a single manual face annotation. The annotation obtained through propagation is not free of error, but can be re-annotated by the system, this time in a verification scenario, which is normally less time consuming than identification.

     \subsection{Qualitative analysis}
    
%Analyse des resultats du Survey

During the survey, participants had to fill a form to give some  feedback about the web front-end. This was done using Google forms \cite{url-google-forms}. The form is available on \cite{url-list-form}, and the results are visible at \cite{url-list-form-results}.

If the users were mainly satisfied with the front-end, they pointed out some features that have to be improved. As examples, some tooltips or titles had to be added to improve the clarity of the UI, which have already been done since the survey. They also brought up that some component have to be revamped. The "context bar" is an instance of component on which we have to work. As a short term solution, we chose to add the thumbnail displaying a capture of the person concerned by the annotation, but this component will be totally rethought later.
